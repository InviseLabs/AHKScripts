This collection of AHK scripts is designed to enhance productivity and efficiency on any workstation. 
Developed by the team at Invise Solutions, these scripts are a staple in our internal operations and are now being offered to clients who want the same productivity enhancements.

Power-users and clients in many industry types find our scripts mmensely useful, which is why we have decided to release them on GitHub. All of these are tested and working on Windows 11.

Our clients, particularly those in industries where technicians are frequently at service stations taking notes, find immense value in scripts such as our AutoCorrect script, which proves indispensable in such settings. Typically, vendors, whose software is used daily by our clients, may impose a monthly fee for AutoCorrect features within their applications, among other restrictive policies. By offering our AutoCorrect and other utility scripts, we aim to simplify daily tasks for many users, and reduce operating costs to clients.

**Commitment to Accessibility:**
 We believe in empowering our users with free, accessible tools that make a noticeable difference in their work lives. That's why we've decided to release these scripts to the public domain, allowing anyone to benefit from our solutions.
